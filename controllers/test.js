Imagine there's a collection of songs. Build a music service that allows creating playlists and filtering songs.

Must haves:

- API to create a playlist
- API to add a song to the playlist

********

Nice to have:

- API to filter songs either by artist, album or playlist

********

Should be able to talk about the changes needed to:

- Work with millions of songs
